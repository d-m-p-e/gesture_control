Gesture control with AI

This project is based on OpenCV and MediaPipe.  
The foundational structure (e.g., webcam handling) follows official examples.  
However, the gesture recognition logic, control structure, and application concept were developed independently.  
The goal was to explore a medically applicable concept using AI-driven gesture control.
